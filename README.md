## About Me

Hi, I'm **Syed Abdullah Rizvi** â€” a **Computer Science and Mathematics student** passionate about building **intelligent systems** that turn innovation into real-world impact.  

I'm deeply interested in **Machine Learning**, **Back-End Development**, and **FinTech**, and I love exploring how **data-driven technologies** can enhance everyday life â€” whether by creating **personalized recommendation systems**, empowering **healthcare solutions**, or developing tools that make a meaningful difference for users.  

Currently, Iâ€™m expanding my expertise through hands-on projects in **recommender systems** and **deep learning**, combining strong foundations in **algorithms**, **systems**, and **applied machine learning** to design **efficient, scalable solutions**.  

Beyond coding, Iâ€™m driven by **curiosity** â€” the desire to understand how complex systems work and how we can make them work better.

Current learning: Exploring how **transformers** work and the inner workings of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to understand how modern AI models learn and interpret language.
